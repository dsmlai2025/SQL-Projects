    "1. In August, there was a peak in patient visits for the year, with 1024 registered patients, indicating a possible seasonal trend or event-driven demand in healthcare services during this month. In contrast, January saw the lowest with 431 visits, suggesting varying healthcare utilization patterns throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The distribution of patient visits between AM and PM is almost equal, with 4632 visits in the morning and 4584 in the afternoon, demonstrating a steady and balanced demand for healthcare services throughout the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A significant number of patients (5400) were not referred to any specific department, illustrating a significant volume of general or non-specialized healthcare needs. Among specialized referrals, General Practice and Orthopedics were the most frequented, pointing to prevalent general health and musculoskeletal issues among the patient population.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There is a slight female predominance in patient visits, with females making up 51% and males 49%, reflecting a marginally higher healthcare utilization by women in the observed patient population.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The highest satisfaction scores are seen in the 21-30 age group, particularly among females, suggesting higher satisfaction with healthcare services in younger adults.
