# Indian Railway Data Generation and Analysis 

A synthetic dataset was generated using the Faker library to simulate Indian railway operations. 
The dataset consists of five CSV files representing key entities: 50 trains, 20 railway stations, 5,000 passengers, 20,000 tickets, and related bookings. 
This data was exported to CSV files organized in a folder for structured storage. 
Subsequent analysis was performed on this dataset to explore operational metrics such as train routes, ticket pricing, passenger behavior, 
and station usage patterns, demonstrating how synthetic data and analytics facilitate railway performance insights.
